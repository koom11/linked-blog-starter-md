> Dwarven. Capital City of the dwarves in The Frozen North


> [!note]+ History
> Dun Hamar is a magnificent and imposing city, the heart and capital of the Irontoe Dwarves, located deep within the Frozen North. It is carved into the very heart of the largest mountain in the region, a towering monolith that pierces the icy skies above the treacherous tundra. The city’s architecture is a testament to the dwarves' incredible craftsmanship and engineering prowess, with multiple levels stacked within the mountain itself, each one more impressive than the last.


# Architecture and Layout
> [!note]+ Overview
> The city is built around a central shaft, the mountain’s natural core, which houses a large elevator that can carry people and goods between the various levels. This elevator, made of intricate metalwork and stone, is the quickest way to traverse the vast vertical expanse of Dun Hamar. The elevator is surrounded by towering stone walls and glowing with the soft light of enchanted crystals embedded within the rock, guiding travelers up and down the immense structure.
> The city is divided into several distinct levels, each serving a different purpose but seamlessly integrated into the mountain’s natural form. The lowest level is primarily focused on industry, with vast forges and smelting pits where the dwarves craft the finest weapons, armor, and machinery. The rumbling of these massive machines can be heard reverberating through the stone as molten metals flow and an endless clang of hammering rings out.
> As one ascends through the levels, the city transitions from industrial to residential and then to the royal and religious districts at the higher elevations. Every level is connected by four sturdy staircases that run along the outer edges of each ring-shaped platform. These staircases are wide, built with reinforced stone, and have intricate carvings of dwarven history and myth adorning their walls. The staircases are designed to be wide enough to accommodate groups of dwarves, often seen marching in unison, their heavy boots echoing against the stone.
> At each level's center, above the elevator, there is a large courtyard or open space, used for communal gatherings or trade. These areas often boast impressive statues, fountains, or monuments to the dwarven ancestors. From these courtyards, pathways branch off to the numerous halls, shops, and homes of the dwarves.

>[!note]+ The Upper Levels
>As the city climbs higher, the architecture shifts to more opulent designs. The noble and royal districts are found at the topmost levels, surrounded by reinforced walls that are both beautiful and impenetrable. Here, the dwarves have carved grand halls with enormous pillars supporting the weight of the mountain above. These halls are adorned with tapestries, glowing gemstones, and intricate metalwork. Massive thrones and long banquet tables stand in the royal chambers, where the Irontoe King and his court hold counsel.
>Dun Hamar’s highest peaks are home to temples and shrines dedicated to the gods of the Irontoe Dwarves. The air grows colder and thinner as one ascends to these levels, but the temples are warmed by the heat of the forge fires and the devotion of the dwarves. It is said that the blessings of the gods are strongest in these holy places, and the priests here are highly revered, often offering guidance to the king.

>[!note]+ Fortifications and Defense
>Dun Hamar’s defenses are second to none. The outer walls of the mountain city are heavily fortified with thick stone and iron, making it nearly impossible for invaders to breach. The city is well-guarded by both stone gargoyles and dwarven sentinels who patrol the levels constantly. The strategic placement of the four staircases and the elevator ensures that in times of conflict, the dwarves can easily funnel their forces to key locations to repel invaders. Additionally, hidden gates and traps are woven throughout the city, ready to thwart any enemies that dare to encroach on the sacred mountain.
>The outer areas of the city, beneath the protective dome of the mountain, feature sprawling markets where traders from all over the Frozen North come to buy and sell wares. These markets are famous for their rare minerals, enchanted items, and exquisite dwarven-made goods. The markets are tightly controlled by the ruling class, and only the most trusted merchants are allowed to trade within the city’s walls.

>[!note]+ Culture and Society
>The dwarves of Dun Hamar are a proud and fiercely independent people, with a culture that values craftsmanship, tradition, and loyalty above all. They take immense pride in their work, whether it be mining the rarest ores from deep within the mountain, forging weapons, or carving intricate designs into the stone itself. The city is alive with the clinking of hammers, the rumble of carts, and the sound of voices singing ancient dwarven songs as they work together to maintain and expand the great city.
>The city’s high culture is built around an appreciation for the arts—music, storytelling, and fine metalwork are highly valued. The royal court regularly hosts performances by bards and musicians who play on the magnificent instruments crafted by the city’s finest artisans. Dun Hamar is also home to a large library of dwarven history and knowledge, where scholars spend their days poring over ancient tomes and manuscripts.

>[!note]+ Climate and Surroundings
>The Frozen North, where Dun Hamar resides, is a land of harsh winters and constant snowfall. The mountain itself is often shrouded in blizzards, with winds howling through the cliffs and ice forming on every surface. Despite these challenges, the dwarves have mastered the art of surviving and thriving in this environment. Inside the city, the temperatures are controlled by ingenious engineering, with the warmth from the forges and natural geothermal energy keeping the interior comfortable year-round.
>The surrounding landscape is a barren tundra, dotted with jagged peaks and icy glaciers. While the land outside is harsh and unforgiving, the dwarves have turned their mountain home into a sanctuary, both safe and self-sufficient, relying on the resources mined from deep within the mountain to support their way of life.
>Dun Hamar stands as a beacon of dwarven strength, resilience, and ingenuity in the heart of the Frozen North. It is a city of unparalleled beauty, skill, and pride—a living testament to the will and determination of the Irontoe Dwarves.
