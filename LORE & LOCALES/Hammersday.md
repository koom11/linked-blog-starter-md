> The celebration involves feasting, drinking, and the ritual reenactment of the historic battle, with dwarven warriors donning ceremonial armor and wielding hammers blessed by the priests of the Stone Father. The mountain's great halls echo with songs of victory and the clash of tankards as the dwarves honor their ancestors' courage. Hammer-shaped pastries are traditionally shared among family members as symbols of strength and unity.
