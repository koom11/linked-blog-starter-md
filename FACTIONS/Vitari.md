>[!note] Backstory
>Evil race of dwarves who are at war with the Irontoe Dwarves of the Frozen North. The Vitari stole the Hammer of Muerin during the Great War after felling the then king of the Irontoe Dwarves, Muerin Irontoe.
>
>The Vitari emerged from the harsh southern wastelands centuries ago, developing a society built on strength and conquest. The Vitari are the dwarves who decided to stay underground while the Irontoes ventured above. Unlike their northern dwarf cousins, the Vitari adapted to the scorching deserts and desolate terrain, becoming harder and more ruthless with each passing generation. Their towering spired cities are said to be marvels of dark engineering and forbidden magic.
>The defining moment in Vitari history came during the Great War, when they launched a daring raid against the Irontoe Dwarves. Led by their most fearsome warriors, they penetrated deep into Irontoe territory and confronted King Muerin Irontoe himself. In the ensuing battle, they struck down the king and claimed his legendary hammer as their prize. This act not only demonstrated their military prowess but also ignited a bitter blood feud that continues to this day.
>Since the theft of the hammer, the Vitari have grown even more isolated and militant. They continue to raid northern territories while expanding their underground empire in the south. Their society values strength above all else, with leadership determined through trials of combat and cunning. They maintain their position through superior metalworking skills and a mastery of desert warfare tactics that make any assault on their territory nearly impossible.
